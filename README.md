# Employee Data Lifecycle - ADP Integration

## Project Overview

The **Employee Data Lifecycle** project automates the creation of employee accounts in ADP using a robust ETL pipeline. This solution extracts employee data from internal systems, processes it, and interacts with the ADP API to automate the creation of user accounts, ensuring seamless synchronization of employee data with minimal manual intervention.

This project leverages technologies like **Apache Spark**, **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, **SendGrid**, and **Airflow** for orchestrating and automating the pipeline. The process ensures scalability and accuracy in creating and maintaining employee accounts at scale.

## Key Features

- **ETL Pipeline**: Extracts employee data from internal systems, transforms the data, and loads it into ADP for account creation.
  
- **ADP API Integration**: Utilizes the ADP API to automate employee account creation and ensure accurate synchronization of employee data.

- **Automation & Scalability**: Automates previously manual tasks, ensuring that the solution scales to handle thousands of employee accounts efficiently.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- **Apache Spark**: Utilized for large-scale data processing and transformation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores internal employee data and serves as a source for the ETL pipeline.
- **SendGrid**: Used for sending email notifications for error handling and logging.
- **Airflow**: Schedules and orchestrates the ETL tasks to ensure automation and reliability.

## Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**: Employee data is extracted from the internal PostgreSQL database.
2. **Data Transformation**: The data is transformed using Spark SQL and the appropriate business logic.
3. **ADP Account Creation**: Transformed data is sent to the ADP API to create employee accounts.
4. **Error Handling**: Errors during the process trigger notifications via SendGrid.
5. **Automation**: The entire pipeline is scheduled and managed by Apache Airflow, ensuring consistent execution.
